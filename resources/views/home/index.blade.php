                Want Tips For Optimizing Your Life And Career?
            </h2>
            <p>
                I’m Darius Foroux, an entrepreneur, author, and investor. I’ve been sharing actionable tips for optimizing your life and work every week since 2015. My ideas have been featured in TIME, NBC, Fast Company, Inc., Observer, and other publications.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I’m continually researching ways we can effectively improve ourselves so we can live with inner joy, tranquility, and certainty. To me, that’s the ultimate goal of personal growth. When you can do work you enjoy, especially on your own terms, you’ll have pleasure every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I write for people who are committed to personal growth, no matter what the external circumstances are. People who want to become better at what they do—one step at a time. That’s also my goal. And my newsletter is where I publish my new insights first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you’re an entrepreneur, artist, programmer, or executive, you’re welcome to join. Every Monday, I’ll send you an article with new useful insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ll also send you my free Growth Kit, a bundle of 6 resources with proven tips for optimizing your life and work. It includes 4 short eBooks, a checklist, and an infographic. Enter your email to join the insiders list and receive the Growth Kit.
